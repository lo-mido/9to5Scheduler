# 9to5Scheduler

The assignment/task was to create a Work Day Scheduler, a simple calendar application allowing users to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9 amâ€“5 pm). The application needed to run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. The starter code provided included the Day.js library for working with date and time.

The motivation behind building this project was to create a valuable tool for managing and organizing daily schedules. As an employee with a busy schedule, keeping track of important events and tasks throughout the day can be challenging. By developing a Work Day Scheduler, I aimed to provide a solution that allows users to add and manage their events effectively, ensuring they can make the most of their time.

The Work Day Scheduler solves the problem of managing and organizing a busy schedule by providing a user-friendly interface to add and save events for each hour of the working day. It allows users to see the current day at the top of the calendar, provides color-coded time blocks to indicate past, present, and future events, and enables users to enter and save event details. The saved events persist even after refreshing the page, ensuring users can rely on the scheduler to organize their schedules.

During the development of this project, I learned several vital aspects. Firstly, I gained experience working with the Day.js library to manipulate and display dates and times. Additionally, I improved my understanding of using jQuery to dynamically update HTML and CSS elements based on user interactions and current times. Lastly, I honed my skills in utilizing local storage to store and retrieve data, enabling saved events to persist even after page refreshes. Building this project allowed me to practice and enhance my skills in JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, CSS, and working with third-party libraries and APIs.which would increase my chances of impressing potential employers.
